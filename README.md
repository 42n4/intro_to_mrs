# Intro to MRS Exercises

Hello! These scripts contain exercises to accompany the Intro to Microsoft R 
Server videos developed by Matt Parker and currently hosted on Microsoft's
[Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Microsoft-R-Server-Series).

There are four videos, but just three sets of exercises. The exercise scripts'
filenames are prefixed with the number of the video they correspond to, and 
end in either "Exercises" or "Solutions". You should start with the Exercises,
naturally. I'd also suggest searching the web for answers to your questions
**before** turning to the solutions file; learning how to find answers on your
own is essential to learning any programming language.

You'll also find two CSV files in this repository, `flights.csv` and 
`airlines.csv`. These are essential for the exercises that accompany the third
and fourth videos. The rest of the datasets used are built in to Microsoft R
Client.

A final note on Server, Client, etc: these videos were developed before
Microsoft R Client was announced, so they always refer to Microsoft R Server.
But for the purposes of the exercises, Microsoft R Client is the software you
need.

Enjoy!
